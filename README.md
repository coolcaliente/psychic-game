# psychic-game

This project is a little game which asks the user to guess what letter the computer has randomly selected from letters a thru z. If the user selects the correct letter within 9 guesses, they win and the computer selects a new word for the chooser to guess. Otherwise if the number of guesses reaches 0, the user loses and a loss is added to the scoreboard.

This game was a good exercise for beginner javascript writers. If you need help with understanding the logic. Fork it and try your own, or if you have questions or need resources, check out W3 Schools at: www.w3schools.com
